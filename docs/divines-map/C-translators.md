Clean text = Project Gutenberg's transcription of Scott's *Works of John Dryden* (18 vols, 1808; PG reprints the 1821 2nd ed.) + PG 228. Titles are cut from those volumes by heading marker; not yet converted to unit-id JSON (the existing converters need a `fetch_sources.py` manifest entry, which the relay may not edit). **No uids minted** — every title awaits Adam's minting pass.
