## 2026-10-02 15:17 CDT — plato-jowett: done
- Vault not reachable from the cloud; worked from the repo (noted once).
- Created `pipeline/fetch_shelf.py` (generalised fetch_edwards.py; adds the Gutenberg COPYRIGHTED gate and refuses 404 pages served as 200).
- Shelf `pipeline/plato_shelf.json`: 29 Gutenberg dialogues (all of Jowett's 3rd ed.) + IA `b24750189_0001..0005` (1892 Clarendon, raw OCR). 34 of 34 fetched (29 PG dialogues, 5 IA vols of the 1892 Clarendon set), 16.6 MB. Trial conversion of the PG texts with convert_gutenberg_prose: 22,162 paragraph units, 1.5M words. Not added to the build manifest (fetch_sources.py is off-limits during the burst) and not minted. No Stephanus numbers in the PG texts; IA set is raw OCR.
- Finding: Alcibiades II and Eryxias were translated by Jowett's secretary Matthew Knight, not Jowett; recorded per title.
- Baseline: tests/structure_test.py 64 passed before and after.
- Awaits minting: all 29 plato-* slugs (+ the 5 raw volumes if Adam wants them addressable).

## 2026-10-02 15:22 CDT — aristotle-ross: done-with-defects
- Shelf `pipeline/aristotle_shelf.json`. 10 Oxford volumes (I, II, IV-XI) + Hammond 1902 De Anima/Parva Naturalia gap-fill fetched as raw IA OCR, 12.0 MB, ~2.0M words, clean-word ratio 0.81-0.89 per volume. Vol. III (1931) and XII (1952) pending on rights. meteorologica00aris fetched then removed: it is all of vol. III (contains the 1931 De Anima).
- Defects: raw OCR only; vol. III and XII missing (rights); Bekker margins survive in vols. VIII–XI (hundreds of matches) but hardly at all in I–VII.
- Finding: the IA item `meteorologica00aris` is mis-catalogued; check sub-title pages, not IA metadata, before trusting a "separate issue".
- Awaits minting: 11 aristotle-* slugs, once Adam decides whether raw volumes get uids.
