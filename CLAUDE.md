# canon-corpus — rules for AI sessions

## What this is
The shared source + structure layer of the Canon OS (Rings 1–2): manifest-
driven fetchers and the structure_texts converters that turn public-domain
texts into unit-id JSON. Extracted from `patrimonium` 2026-07-22 (its
history up to commit `d33503e` is the pre-extraction acquisitions ledger).
Consumers: **armarium** (sibling repo), patrimonium, and later Memoria and
the Resolver. Owner: Adam — hobbyist; beginner-friendly explanations
appreciated.

The living truth for project state is the Obsidian vault:
`9 - Projects/Armarium/_STATUS — Armarium.md`. Read it first.

## Golden rules
1. **Manifests ARE the collection.** PERSEUS/CCEL/GUTENBERG_EXTRA dicts in
   `pipeline/fetch_sources.py` + `data/books/manifest.json` are committed;
   corpus texts and built JSON are gitignored and rebuildable. Commit
   history is the acquisitions ledger — one commit per acquisition wave.
2. **Never hand-edit a source text.** Fixes live in per-book rules in
   `structure_texts.py` so they rerun on refetch.
3. **The unit id is the spine** of the whole suite: canonical citation ↔
   unit id ↔ any edition's page. Do not change existing id schemes without
   a vault ruling; CTS-URN alignment is pending (ids stay short, manifest
   records the URN per edition).
4. **Honesty fields are load-bearing.** Every book's `scheme.honesty`
   states its real citation resolution; never pretend precision.
5. **Builds are resumable + atomic** (temp-file + rename; skip finished
   books). Keep it that way — a killed run must never corrupt output.
6. IP posture: host/structure/publish public-domain freely; map facts
   about copyrighted translations, never copy. CCEL asks non-commercial
   use of some prepared editions — check per work before republishing.

## Commands
    python3 pipeline/fetch_sources.py        # fetch everything missing (resumable)
    python3 pipeline/fetch_sources.py --list # show the manifests
    python3 pipeline/structure_texts.py      # build data/books/*.json + manifest
    python3 tests/structure_test.py          # 18 offline checks (no corpus needed)

## Layout
- pipeline/fetch_sources.py — PERSEUS (TEI) + CCEL (ThML) + GUTENBERG (.txt)
  manifests and fetcher; downloads land in data/corpus/ (gitignored)
- pipeline/structure_texts.py — the converters: TEI / ThML / KJV /
  Gutenberg verse–prose–drama → data/books/<slug>.json (gitignored) +
  data/books/manifest.json (committed: checksums, schemes, provenance)
- tests/structure_test.py — offline converter checks, fixtures inline

## Sandbox mechanics (inherited from patrimonium — they apply here)
- Do NOT run live git in a mounted/synced folder — copy to /tmp, run git
  there, copy the .git back. `git config core.fileMode false` in fresh copies.
- No detached background jobs; chunk long work into <45 s foreground calls;
  keep scripts resumable.
- Big builds: build to /tmp then copy in (mounted disks are slow; Adam's
  native Windows disk is fast).

## Scaling (decided, don't re-litigate — see vault "Armarium at scale")
Before thousands of books: manifests become CSV, parallel structure
conversion, throttled bulk fetch. The data model itself already scales.

## End every working session
Update the vault _STATUS note (state, one dated log line, next actions)
and commit. A session that doesn't update the status note didn't happen.

## Lexicons — a fourth door (2026-09-06)

Three reference works now ingest through the same converters and the same
output shape: **Strong's Hebrew** (H1–H8674), **Strong's Greek** (G1–G5624),
and the **unabridged Brown-Driver-Briggs** (10,022 entries). Sources are in
`LEXICONS` in `fetch_sources.py`; converters are `convert_strongs_hebrew`,
`convert_strongs_greek`, `convert_bdb`.

**Why they needed no schema change.** A lexicon is not a linear text, but the
unit id was always the citation hub, and for a lexicon the canonical citation
IS the entry number — `strongs-hebrew:H2617`. Cross-references go in
`links[]`, the field the ThML scripRef harvest already fills. Result:
**25,609 cross-references, zero dangling**, and the three books are one
connected graph. Extra lexical fields (lemma, translit, pos, KJV usage) hang
off each unit under `lex` so the `{id, ref, text, links[]}` contract every
other converter emits is untouched.

**Rights (rule 6 / the 2026-07-26 gate).** All three underlying works are
public domain and the rights line of each exact edition was read, not assumed.
The OpenScriptures markup is CC BY 4.0 over PD dictionary text; the BDB repo
states "Public domain document". Recorded per entry in `LEXICONS`.

**What is deliberately NOT claimed (rule 4).** BDB cites scripture in Hebrew
versification, which parts company with the KJV's — most visibly in Psalms,
where a superscription counts as verse 1 and shifts every later verse. So its
**139,125 scripture citations are recorded as the source stated them**
(`{osis, ref, versification: "bhs", resolved: false}`) and are NOT resolved to
`kjv:` unit ids. Resolving them needs a versification map; that is its own
piece of work. A labelled hole beats a confident wrong label.

**Thayer's is queued, not skipped.** Thayer's Greek-English Lexicon (1889) is
PD and scanned (archive.org `greekenglishlexi00grimuoft`, 764pp,
NOT_IN_COPYRIGHT), but **no usable machine-readable edition exists**: that
scan's OCR contains **zero Greek codepoints** — every Greek word came out as
mangled Latin (`édris` for ἐλπίς) — measured 2026-09-06. Abbott-Smith's 1922
lexicon fails the same way. Thayer's therefore needs a polytonic-Greek OCR
pass (`tesseract grc`) and is a book-sized job, not a download. STEPBible ships
a full LSJ keyed to Strong's that would fill the same gap today, but it is
CC BY 4.0 rather than PD and its own header asks that it not be redistributed
— Adam's call, deliberately not taken here.

### 🔴 A partial build used to delete the ledger

`structure_texts.py`'s `main()` started `manifest = {}` and wrote whatever it
built. A run only sees the sources fetched locally, so **a lexicons-only build
rewrote a 66-book manifest with 3 entries** (caught 2026-09-06 before it was
committed). The manifest IS the collection — rule 1 — so `main()` now seeds
from the committed manifest and updates it. Never let it start empty again.

## Rights check — the gate that was missing (2026-07-26)

`kafka-metamorphosis` (PG 5200) was removed from `pipeline/adler_shelf.json`.
It is the **David Wyllie translation**, whose Gutenberg header reads
`*** This is a COPYRIGHTED Project Gutenberg eBook. ***`. Armarium was serving
it whole and offering it for download with the PG notice stripped.

**Why it got through:** the acquisition run verified AUTHOR and TITLE against the
live PG header. It never read the rights line. An author dead in 1924 tells you
nothing about the person who Englished him in 2002.

**All 68 were re-checked on 2026-07-26** by fetching each PG header and grepping
for the copyright marker. Twelve entries were foreign-language works with no
translator recorded; **eleven are genuinely public domain, and Kafka was the only
copyrighted one.** The translator is now recorded in the `author` field for the
six where PG names one and the shelf did not.

**The standing rule from here:** a title does not enter this shelf until someone
has read the rights line of the exact edition, not the author's dates. Translations
carry their own copyright. When adding a book, check for
`COPYRIGHTED Project Gutenberg` in the header and record the translator in `author`.
