# canon-corpus — rules for AI sessions

## What this is
The shared source + structure layer of the Canon OS (Rings 1–2): manifest-
driven fetchers and the structure_texts converters that turn public-domain
texts into unit-id JSON. Extracted from `patrimonium` 2026-07-22 (its
history up to commit `d33503e` is the pre-extraction acquisitions ledger).
Consumers: **armarium** (sibling repo), patrimonium, and later Memoria and
the Resolver. Owner: Adam — hobbyist; beginner-friendly explanations
appreciated.

The living truth for project state is the Obsidian vault:
`9 - Projects/Armarium/_STATUS — Armarium.md`. Read it first.

## Golden rules
1. **Manifests ARE the collection.** PERSEUS/CCEL/GUTENBERG_EXTRA dicts in
   `pipeline/fetch_sources.py` + `data/books/manifest.json` are committed;
   corpus texts and built JSON are gitignored and rebuildable. Commit
   history is the acquisitions ledger — one commit per acquisition wave.
2. **Never hand-edit a source text.** Fixes live in per-book rules in
   `structure_texts.py` so they rerun on refetch.
3. **The unit id is the spine** of the whole suite: canonical citation ↔
   unit id ↔ any edition's page. Do not change existing id schemes without
   a vault ruling; CTS-URN alignment is pending (ids stay short, manifest
   records the URN per edition).
4. **Honesty fields are load-bearing.** Every book's `scheme.honesty`
   states its real citation resolution; never pretend precision.
5. **Builds are resumable + atomic** (temp-file + rename; skip finished
   books). Keep it that way — a killed run must never corrupt output.
6. IP posture: host/structure/publish public-domain freely; map facts
   about copyrighted translations, never copy. CCEL asks non-commercial
   use of some prepared editions — check per work before republishing.

## Commands
    python3 pipeline/fetch_sources.py        # fetch everything missing (resumable)
    python3 pipeline/fetch_sources.py --list # show the manifests
    python3 pipeline/structure_texts.py      # build data/books/*.json + manifest
    python3 tests/structure_test.py          # 18 offline checks (no corpus needed)

## Layout
- pipeline/fetch_sources.py — PERSEUS (TEI) + CCEL (ThML) + GUTENBERG (.txt)
  manifests and fetcher; downloads land in data/corpus/ (gitignored)
- pipeline/structure_texts.py — the converters: TEI / ThML / KJV /
  Gutenberg verse–prose–drama → data/books/<slug>.json (gitignored) +
  data/books/manifest.json (committed: checksums, schemes, provenance)
- tests/structure_test.py — offline converter checks, fixtures inline

## Sandbox mechanics (inherited from patrimonium — they apply here)
- Do NOT run live git in a mounted/synced folder — copy to /tmp, run git
  there, copy the .git back. `git config core.fileMode false` in fresh copies.
- No detached background jobs; chunk long work into <45 s foreground calls;
  keep scripts resumable.
- Big builds: build to /tmp then copy in (mounted disks are slow; Adam's
  native Windows disk is fast).

## Scaling (decided, don't re-litigate — see vault "Armarium at scale")
Before thousands of books: manifests become CSV, parallel structure
conversion, throttled bulk fetch. The data model itself already scales.

## End every working session
Update the vault _STATUS note (state, one dated log line, next actions)
and commit. A session that doesn't update the status note didn't happen.

## Rights check — the gate that was missing (2026-07-26)

`kafka-metamorphosis` (PG 5200) was removed from `pipeline/adler_shelf.json`.
It is the **David Wyllie translation**, whose Gutenberg header reads
`*** This is a COPYRIGHTED Project Gutenberg eBook. ***`. Armarium was serving
it whole and offering it for download with the PG notice stripped.

**Why it got through:** the acquisition run verified AUTHOR and TITLE against the
live PG header. It never read the rights line. An author dead in 1924 tells you
nothing about the person who Englished him in 2002.

**All 68 were re-checked on 2026-07-26** by fetching each PG header and grepping
for the copyright marker. Twelve entries were foreign-language works with no
translator recorded; **eleven are genuinely public domain, and Kafka was the only
copyrighted one.** The translator is now recorded in the `author` field for the
six where PG names one and the shelf did not.

**The standing rule from here:** a title does not enter this shelf until someone
has read the rights line of the exact edition, not the author's dates. Translations
carry their own copyright. When adding a book, check for
`COPYRIGHTED Project Gutenberg` in the header and record the translator in `author`.
